400/400. Results are sorted by points and then by the earliest submission.
Fairly easy exam, this time it was split in two pieces.
I should be in the top 5 of all the 500 participants.
We had 3 hours to do the first two problems (CharityMarathon and Ladybugs). I finished those around 5th place.
After a 30 minute break, they opened up and showed us the last two problems (NetherRealms and RoliTheCoder).
We had 3 hours to do those as well, where I was the first to solve both with maximum points.
To prove that, I've attached a photo showing the results in the judge system. The person (Gesh4o) who's above me is
Georgi Stoimen, who was one of the lecturers for the course, so he obviously doesn't count. (He solved it beforehand, most likely)
